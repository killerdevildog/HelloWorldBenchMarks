Benchmarking "Hello, World!" Programs Across Languages
Purpose

This project benchmarks "Hello, World!" programs in as many programming languages as possible. The vision is to systematically test every language and its compatible compiler/interpreter to:

    Compare execution speed (and, eventually, other performance characteristics)

    Rank languages by how quickly they complete identical, minimal programs

    Encourage curiosity and discussion about programming paradigms and performance differences

The project goes beyond simply finding the "fastest language"—it aims to create a fun, insightful leaderboard of various approaches to solving the same simple problem.
Planned Categories

Languages will ultimately be grouped by their execution model or ecosystem, providing apples-to-apples context within each group:

    Compiled Languages (e.g., C++, Rust, Go)

    Interpreted Languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, Bash)

    VM-Based Languages (e.g., Java, C#, Kotlin)

    Scripting/Markup Languages (e.g., HTML, JavaScript)

    Other Special Cases (e.g., Assembly, Esoteric languages)

As the project evolves, new classes or subcategories may be added!
Why "Hello, World!"?

    It's the classic starting point for all languages

    Easy to compare identical output across platforms

    Interestingly, even with such a simple task, language and runtime choice can have a big impact on performance

Isn’t Assembly the Fastest?

It’s a common assumption that assembly is unsurpassed in raw speed. This project will put that idea—and many others—to the test by running benchmarks in practice, revealing how real implementations stack up.
How You Can Help

    Submit a "Hello, World!" program in your favorite language (or favorite compiler/interpreter)!

    Check out the leaderboard and learn

    Discuss, critique, and have fun exploring the quirks of programming languages and their runtimes

The Leaderboard (Coming Soon)

This section will display rankings by runtime, grouped by category, so you can see at a glance which approaches are fastest, slowest, or most surprising.

Stay tuned as the results start rolling in!
